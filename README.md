# PBVoiceNote
A simple voice recorder built for Windows Phone using c#

This is a very simple "Voice Note Recorder" 
It allows the user to record a message using their device's microphone and then play it back. 
There are many uses for such an app, such as:
Recording lectures in college, saving a shopping list for yourself or even just making an audio reminder etc.

Or maybe, you just want to test your voice for the next big Karaoke night.

I decided to keep the app simple and very quick to use without too much complicaitons. 

How to use: 
1. Press the "Record" button.
2. Speak into your device's microphone
3. Press the "Stop" button.
4. Press the "Play" button to play your voice note back
